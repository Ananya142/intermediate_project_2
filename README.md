**Overview**

 The project allow us to develop a contract called MyToken with Solidity. Users can create tokens and send them to different addresses. The project consists of a Solidity smart contract and a basic frontend interface made with HTML, JavaScript, and Web3.js for user interaction.

**Functions**

**- constructor(uint256 initialSupply):** Sets up the token with an initial supply.

**- transfer(address to, uint256 amount):** Permits the transfer of tokens between addresses, making sure there is enough balance.

**(mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf::** This balance of fumction tracks the balance of tokens for each address.
